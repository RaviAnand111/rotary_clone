# Next.js Project

## Rotary.org website clone with `Next.js and TailwindCSS`

This is a clone of rotary.org website. This is a fully responsive website. I made it as this was given in one of my assignment for a frontend role. I have included `animation, transition, hover effect`. I have used `flexbox and grid` as well in this website. I have used `useState, useEffect`and other hooks as well in this website.
